## The problem we are solving

In the bustling world of food and beverage, we noticed a significant gap. Many restaurants, especially smaller ones, struggle with establishing an online presence for their menus and order systems. This often results in a disjointed experience for customers who are increasingly seeking the convenience of online ordering.

FindPlate aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform where restaurants can easily list their menus and accept orders online, and where customers can seamlessly navigate these menus and place orders at their convenience.

## Solution: FindPlate

FindPlate is an all-in-one online food ordering platform. We were inspired by companies like [Just Eat](https://www.just-eat.co.uk/) and [Eatourist](https://eatourist.com/), but we wanted to create a solution that was more tailored to the needs of smaller restaurants.

Our platform allows each restaurant to have a unique link `restaurant.findplate.com` that customers can use to view the menu and place orders. We support multiple languages to cater to a global audience and offer various subscription options to fit the needs of different restaurants.

## Open Source

Transparency and collaboration are at the heart of FindPlate. We believe that by involving our users in the development process, we can build a better product. Whether it's through user feedback, building in public, or open-sourcing parts of our system, we are committed to maintaining an open and collaborative approach.

We are excited about the potential of FindPlate to transform the online food ordering experience for both restaurants and customers. Join us on this journey as we work towards making FindPlate the go-to platform for online food ordering.
